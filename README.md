# react-retreat
This is our capstone project for the Trilogy Web Development Boot Camp. A fully functional progressive web application is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). GraphQL is used for the query language. State management is performed with Redux. Authentication is performed with JSON Web Token.
